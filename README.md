Allows you to type in an IP address and identify the location, proxy/VPN status, and other information associated with the IP address. Can be useful if you want to quickly check whether your VPN is actually connected and isn't leaking out.

## Usage
Simply type in any IP address and click the lookup button or use the return key on your keyboard. If you're are trying to search your own IP address and don't know it off the top of your head, leave the textbox empty and it will automatically use your current IP address when you lookup.
